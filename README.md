`locus` is library for Erlang/OTP and Elixir that allows you to pinpoint
the country, city or ASN of IP addresses using [MaxMind
GeoIP2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) and [other
providers](#alternative-providers).

The databases will be loaded on-demand and, when retrieved from the
network, cached on the filesystem and updated automatically.

## Usage

#### 1\. Configure your license key

*Skip this step if you're not loading databases directly from
MaxMind.*

Get a free [license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)
from MaxMind if you haven't one already. Once logged in, you'll find the
page to generate it on the left menu, under "Manage License Keys".

Then clone the repository, run `make shell` and declare your key:

``` erlang
application:set_env(locus, license_key, "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY").
```

If you're using Elixir, add locus as a dependency to your mix project:

```elixir
defp deps do
    [
      ...
      {:locus, "~> 2.3"}
    ]
  end
```

Then, configure your license key in `config.exs`:

```elixir
config :locus,
  license_key: <MAXMIND_API_KEY>
```

#### 2\. Start the database loader

``` erlang
ok = locus:start_loader(country, {maxmind, "GeoLite2-Country"}).
% You can also use:
% * an HTTP(S) URL,
% * or a local path, e.g. "/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLite2-City.mmdb"
% * or a {custom_fetcher, Module, Args} tuple, with Module
%   implementing the locus_custom_fetcher behaviour.
```

In Elixir, you'll need to specify the cache directory explicitly when starting the database loaders. You can do that in `application.ex`:

```elixir
  require Logger
  ...

  def start(_type, _args) do
    # only start the database loader process in environments where a license key is defined
    if Application.get_env(:locus, :license_key) do
      locus_cache_directory = "/tmp/locus/"

      case File.mkdir(locus_cache_directory) do
        :ok ->
          Logger.info("New directory created for IP geolocation cache: #{locus_cache_directory}")

        {:error, :eexist} ->
          Logger.info("Loading IP geolocation cache from: #{locus_cache_directory}")
      end

      # :locus.start_loader(:asn, {:maxmind, "GeoLite2-ASN"},
      #   database_cache_file: Path.join([locus_cache_directory, "maxmind_asn.mmdb.gz"])
      # )

      # :locus.start_loader(:country, {:maxmind, "GeoLite2-Country"},
      #   database_cache_file: Path.join([locus_cache_directory, "maxmind_country.mmdb.gz"])
      # )

      :locus.start_loader(:city, {:maxmind, "GeoLite2-City"},
        database_cache_file: Path.join([locus_cache_directory, "maxmind_city.mmdb.gz"])
      )
    end
    ...
```

#### 3\. Wait for the database to load (optional)

``` erlang
{ok, _DatabaseVersion} = locus:await_loader(country). % or `{error, Reason}'
```

#### 4\. Look up IP addresses

``` erlang

% > locus:lookup(country, "93.184.216.34").
% > locus:lookup(country, "2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946").

% * '{ok, Entry}' in case of success;
% * 'not_found' if no entry was found
% * '{error, _}' if something bad happened

                  <<"ru">> => <<"США"/utf8>>,
                  <<"zh-CN">> => <<"美国"/utf8>>}}}}
```

Or, in Elixir, call the erlang library from your Elixir application:

```elixir
iex> :locus.lookup(:city, "93.184.216.34")
{:ok,
 %{
   "city" => %{"geoname_id" => 4945936, "names" => %{"en" => "Norwell"}},
   ...
 }}
```

### Supported File Formats

  - gzip-compressed tarballs (`.tar.gz`, `.tgz`)
  - plain tarballs (`.tar`)
  - MMDB files (`.mmdb`)
  - gzip-compressed MMDB files (`.mmdb.gz`)

For tarball files, the first file to be found within it with an `.mmdb`
extension is the one that's chosen for loading.

The implementation of [MaxMind DB
format](https://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/) is complete except for
the [`data cache
container`](https://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/#data-cache-container---12)
data type.

### Database Types and Loading

  - The free GeoLite2 [Country, City and ASN
    databases](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) were all
    successfully tested; presumably `locus` can deal with [any MMDB
    database](#alternative-providers) that maps IP address prefixes to
    arbitrary data
  - The databases are loaded into memory (mostly) as is; reference
    counted binaries are shared with the application callers using
    [`persistent_term`](https://erlang.org/doc/man/persistent_term.html),
    and the original binary search tree is used to lookup addresses. The
    data for each entry is decoded on the fly upon successful lookups.

### Database Validation

Databases, local or remote, can have their compatibility validated
through the `locus:check/1` function after they've been loaded (see
[function reference](#api-reference).)

Alternatively, they can also be checked from the command line by use of
the `locus` CLI utility:

1.  Run `make cli` to build the script, named `locus`, which will be
    deployed to the current directory.

2.  Check the database:

    ``` shell
    ./locus check GeoLite2-City.mmdb
    # Loading database from "GeoLite2-City.mmdb"...
    # Database version {{2019,11,6},{11,58,0}} successfully loaded
    # Checking database for flaws...
    # Database is wholesome.
    ```

The script will exit with code 1 in case of failure, and 0 otherwise.

Warnings can produce failure through the `--warnings-as-errors` flag.

Run `./locus check --help` for a description of supported options and
arguments.

### Remote sources: Downloading and Updating

  - The downloaded database files, when compressed, are inflated in
    memory
  - For MaxMind and HTTP downloads, the `last-modified` response header,
    if present, is used to condition subsequent download attempts (using
    `if-modified-since` request headers) in order to save bandwidth
  - The downloaded databases are cached on the filesystem in order to
    more quickly achieve readiness on future launches of the database
    loader
  - Database download attempts are retried upon error according to an
    exponential backoff policy - quickly at first (every few seconds)
    but gradually slowing down to every 15 minutes. Successful and
    dismissed download attempts will be checked for update after 6
    hours. Both of these behaviours can be tweaked through the
    `error_retries` and `update_period` loader settings (see [function
    reference](#api-reference).)
  - When downloading from a MaxMind edition or an HTTP URL, the remote
    certificate will be authenticated against [a list of known
    Certification
    Authorities](https://hexdocs.pm/tls_certificate_check/) and
    connection negotiation will fail in case of an expired certificate,
    mismatched hostname, self-signed certificate or unknown
    certification authority. These checks can be disabled by specifying
    the `insecure` loader option.

### Remote sources: Caching

  - Caching is a best effort; the system falls back to relying
    exclusively on the network if needed
  - By default a caching directory named `locus_erlang` is created under the
    ['user\_cache'
    basedir](http://erlang.org/doc/man/filename.html#basedir-3)
  - A cached database is named after either:
      - the MaxMind database edition name (when explicitly downloading
        from MaxMind), or
      - the SHA256 hash of the HTTP(S) URL, or
      - for `{custom_fetcher, Module, Args}` sources, a filesystem-safe
        version of `Module`'s name concatenated with the 32-bit
        [`erlang:phash2/2`](https://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#phash2-2)
        value of the opaque database source as returned by the
        callbacks.
  - Modification time of the databases is retrieved from either:
      - the `last-modified` response header (when present, for MaxMind
        and HTTP(S) sources)
      - the `modified_on` metadata property for successful
        `locus_custom_fetcher` `:fetch/1` and `:conditionally_fetch/2`
        callbacks (for databases loaded with `locus_custom_fetcher`)
  - Caching can be disabled by specifying the `no_cache` option when
    running `:start_loader`
  - The cache database location can be customised by providing
    `{database_cache_file, FilePath}` option for `locus_loader`
    (`FilePath` must have a ".mmdb.gz" extension)

### Local sources: Loading and Updating

  - The loaded database files, when compressed, are inflated in memory
  - The database modification timestamp is used to condition subsequent
    load attempts in order to lower I/O activity
  - Database load attempts are retried upon error according to an
    exponential backoff policy - quickly at first (every few seconds)
    but gradually slowing down to every 30 seconds. Successful and
    dismissed load attempts will be checked for update after 30 seconds.
    Both of these behaviours can be tweaked through the `error_retries`
    and `update_period` loader settings (see [function
    reference](#api-reference).)

### Logging

  - Five logging levels are supported: `debug`, `info`, `warning`,
    `error` and `none`
  - The chosen backend is
    [logger](http://erlang.org/doc/man/logger.html) *if*
    [lager](https://github.com/erlang-lager/lager/) is either missing or
    it hasn't
    [removed](https://github.com/erlang-lager/lager/issues/492)
    `logger`'s default handler.
  - The default log level is `error`; it can be changed in the
    application's `env` config
  - To tweak the log level in runtime, use `locus_logger:set_loglevel/1`

### Event Subscriptions

  - Any number of event subscribers can be attached to a database loader
    by specifying the `{event_subscriber, Subscriber}` option when
    starting the database
  - A `Subscriber` can be either a module implementing the
    `locus_event_subscriber` behaviour or an arbitrary `pid()`
  - The format and content of reported events can be consulted in detail
    on the `locus_event_subscriber` module documentation; most key steps
    in the loader pipeline are reported (download started, download
    succeeded, download failed, caching succeeded, loading failed, etc.)

### API Reference

The API reference can be found on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/locus/).

### Tested setup

  - Erlang/OTP 24 or newer
  - rebar3
